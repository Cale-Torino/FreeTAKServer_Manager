### FreeTAKServer Manager

The FreeTAKServer Manager  specific for FTS version `1.9.6.1`

Make sure you have a clean Python install.

Make sure your python environment variable path is clean.

Due to changing config files etc. I have to compile a new version for every new FTS release.

Tested on Python 3.8.10

FreeTAKServer Manager has the ability to:
* Start
* Stop
* Restart
* Install
* Uninstall
* start on startup
* send alert emails
* let the user test the API (localhost & custom)
* allow quick `MainConfig.py` & `config.py` edits
* Open a portforward testing page
